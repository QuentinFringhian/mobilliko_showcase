# Mob'illiko Showcase

**Mob'illiko Showcase** is a web application built with **Flutter** that demonstrates a potential implementation of the full **Mob'illiko** project. The app is designed to work offline and can be installed directly on mobile devices, giving users a seamless experience even without internet access.

## Project Overview

The **Mob'illiko Showcase** is a lightweight preview of the **Mob'illiko** app concept. It presents a few select features of the full product idea, focusing on how users would interact with scratchable games provided by **FDJ** (Française des Jeux). The app uses mock data for demonstration purposes and does not include backend functionality, payment processing, or real-world game mechanics.

## Full Project Vision: Mob'illiko

The **Mob'illiko** app is designed to let users browse, select, and play FDJ scratch games directly from their mobile devices. Here's how the full version would work:

- Users explore various scratch card games.
- After choosing a game, they can purchase it through the app.
- Once purchased, users can interact with the scratch card, revealing the hidden areas by "scratching" them virtually.
- Depending on the game, users could potentially win real prizes.

The **Mob'illiko Showcase** gives a glimpse of this vision by showing a minimal version of these interactions.

## Features in the Showcase

1. **Scratchable Games Simulation**: Users can select from a small number of preloaded scratch card games and interact with them.
2. **Offline Functionality**: The app can be added to mobile home screens and works offline.
3. **Mock Data**: All the games and interactions are simulated with mock data.
4. **Flutter Web App**: Built using Flutter for a smooth, cross-platform experience.

## Limitations of the Showcase

- **No Backend**: There is no real server or database; all data is static.
- **No Payment**: Payment functionality is not implemented as it is for demonstration purposes only.
- **Limited Features**: The showcase includes only a few features of the full vision of **Mob'illiko**.
- **No Real Prizes**: The games are purely for demonstration purposes, and no real money or prizes are involved.
